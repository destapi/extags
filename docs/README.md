# ExTag

This project started out as a way of stitching together different markup templates, with the goal of trying out [htmx](https://htmx.org/). 
As I completed each feature that I had in mind, I kept bending to the temptation to add another feature, and the features list kept growing. 
I had to take a hard pause so that I could start documenting how everything works, and that way I would be able to keep track of what is 
done and also keep track of the features' wish list.

## Current features

1. Using MVEL templating engine to integrate with a Java backend
2. Prepending a regular html tag with __x-__ to point out that it needs special treatment, and similarly prepending custom tag attributes with
__x-__ to point out they have pertinent information for the parser
3. Using well-formed __xhtml__ to describe the html elements, to skip reinventing the wheel
4.
